This add-on collects threat indicators published by AusCERT and indexes them in Splunk.

It can collect indicators from the AusCERT malware and phishing feeds. This runs as a modular input which gather the data from the AusCERT API. A valid AusCERT API key is required.

Additionally, a disabled scheduled search will push these indicators into the Splunk for Enterprise Security threat intelligence framework. Enable this saved search if you are running this add-on with Splunk ES.
